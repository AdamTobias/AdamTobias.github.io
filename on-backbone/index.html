            <p>I've been learning how to utilize the Backbone framework recently and I wanted to share some of my findings.  While flexibility is a point in Backbone's favor, this seems to have lead to a lack of agreed-upon best practices and some uncertainty on how exactly to fit the various views and models together.  Below is some of my insight on the matter.</p>

<h5 id="views">Views</h5>

<p>Views are used to generate and interact with everything on the DOM.  Each view should represent some cohesive unit displayed on the DOM.  Often, a parent view will contain multiple sub-views for each unit created.  For example, on a twitter-esque application, views would be created for each tweet displayed.  A parent view would hold all of these tweet views and represent the 'tweets' area of the page.  </p>

<p>When variable data is required to generate the view, a model or collection should be included in the view to hold that data.  If the DOM elements do not rely on a changing data source, no model is required.</p>

<p>Views listen to DOM events via the 'events' object, which is a Backbone-supported property of the View class.  If a view needs to listen for model or view events, these listeners are created upon initialization of the view (typically).  They should not be put in the 'events' property.</p>

<p><strong>Views should only be used to interact with the DOM.</strong>  Any code required to manipulate data should be passed off to the corresponding model or collection.</p>

<h5 id="models">Models</h5>

<p>Models contain and interact with the app's data.  Like views, models should be created to represent a cohesive set of data, to as low of a level as makes sense.  For example, while one model could be used to hold all of the messages displayed on the screen in a chat application, instead each message should be represented by its own model.  If there are a group of models of the same type, these can all be wrapped up in a Collection.</p>

<p>Models are often properties of views, but never the other way around.  This means that when the user provides data via the DOM, the View must pass that information off to its model.  The model cannot listen for the data or events directly.  Models can however listen for other model events if they are included as properties.</p>

<p>This may tempt the designer to nest models within other models for the sake of event listening when the application structures does not merit this.  To keep everything organized and clean, models should only have sub-models as properties when it is logical that the sub-model would belong to its parent in the context of the application.  This can sometimes lead to data being passed through multiple models and views to arrive at their necessary destination.  This is ok!  It is far easier to grok the flow of data through your Backbone application when a coherent and logical framework is established.</p>

<p>Application-logic should be placed in the lowest level model possible.  For example, it is possible to send all data up to the highest-level model and allow decision making to occur there.  However, it is preferred to let the sub-models handle this logic at the lowest-level possible.  In this way, tasks are delegated in a consistent manner.</p>

<h5 id="collections">Collections</h5>

<p>Collections represent a group of same-type Models that behave similarly.  Frankly, I'm not entirely sure what the upside is for using a Collection in place of a Model, which could potentially store an array or object of sub-models.  It seems like Backbone recognizes that this is a very common pattern and has provided a Collection class with some helper functions to better help you manage the sub-models.  I think it is most helpful to think of Collections in the same way as Models, but for a specific use.</p>

<h5 id="somebigpicturestuff">Some Big Picture Stuff</h5>

<p>As I get more familiar with the idea of an MVC framework, it becomes more apparent to me that the bottom line is not always efficiency and ease-of-use.  Passing data around the models and views can be inefficient and generate unnecessary code.  So why do we do it?</p>

<p>The benefit is a consistent structure and modularity.  As my applications get larger and more complex, it becomes very obvious that having a home for each piece of your code is extremely advantageous.  When new logic must be introduced, it should be apparent where in your framework it should go.  The structure of your application and the structure of your code are mirrored, which greatly contributes to the concept of self-documenting code.  </p>

<p>Ultimately, working with a framework for the first time can be frustrating, as it restricts the developer's ability to do certain things.  Hopefully this post will help you understand how to make the framework work for you instead of the other way around!</p>
