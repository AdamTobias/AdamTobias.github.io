        <section class="post-content">
            <p>I've been working on a project for Hack Reactor infrastructure that provides employees with an interface to view, create, and manage some of the scheduling that occurs throughout the school.  This project is part of a larger collection of applications that performs the overall task of making sure all the trains run on time, so to speak. While my team's project involves the creation and delegation of various tasks, sometimes I became frustrated with the fact that I could not access various resources I required directly.  </p>

<p>If I wanted to access the collection of employee's at the school, I could not simply query this database -- instead, this information was available via an Employee API that I have no control over.  Despite everyone working towards the same overall goal, we are splintered into small groups that build independent projects and are forced to see the other groups as external resources or customers.  This seemed counterproductive, until one day it clicked for me.  These philosophies are a hallmark for good general coding practices.  As I learned more about the idea, I was introduced to the benefits and restraints of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).</p>

<h6 id="services">Services</h6>

<p>SOA is a buzzword in the back-end community, but what does it really mean, and what are the benefits of this style?  Firstly, we should define the concept of a service.  In a general sense, a service is it's own server, dedicated to handling all the operations related to a specific subtask.  These services often only interact with other services, but not necessarily.  For example, a Stack Overflow-type application may have a service dedicated solely to user authentication, another service that manages User and Question/Answer statistics, and another service in charge of emailing users when their questions have been responded to.</p>

<p>A well-implemented service should be a black-box.  The internal logic is abstracted away and is simply usable as a resource to perform some task.  Additionally, services should be as independent as possible.  This is referred to as <strong>loose coupling</strong>.  Any dependencies between services should be kept to a minimum.  Services should be stateless and adhere to a well-defined communication protocol (make everything RESTful and you should be good to go).</p>

<p>This description of services and how to best implement them should sound familiar to you.  In effect, this is the same philosophy we employ when we write functions.  Like services, functions abstract away the complexity of some operation.  They should have as limited scope as possible and not be dependent on things outside their scope if at all possible.  Both services and functions are useful for their <strong>composability</strong> -- we can use these small, discrete tools to build a more powerful application.</p>

<h6 id="whataretheadvantagestosoa">What are the advantages to SOA?</h6>

<p>If you were paying attention in the last paragraph, you should have some idea on some of the advantages of service oriented architecture -- many of them are similar to the advantages of writing good functions.  </p>

<p>Testing -- by making our services atomic in nature, we can isolate and test their behavior with as few outside variables as possible</p>

<p>Composability -- as mentioned above, services are building blocks.  We can arrange them in different configurations as we see fit.</p>

<p>Separation of concerns (development) -- SOA allows developers to focus solely on functionality of one component and can assume proper functionality for the other resources.</p>

<p>Scalability -- This is a big one.  When designing your application, it is likely that various components will need to scale at a different rate than others.  By splitting each operation into it's own service, you can be selective about where and how to scale without impacting the rest of the system.</p>

<p>Durability -- Since our system is loosely coupled, our various features are not dependent on one another.  This means that if we one of our services crashes, the rest of our functionality should be maintained.</p>

<p>Reusability -- Each of our services is built to be an outward-facing API that follows a consistent pattern.  A lot of the framework for each service may be used to create additional services.</p>

<h6 id="summary">Summary</h6>

<p>Service Oriented Architecture sounds complicated and abstract, but it is really just a re-application of many of the same concepts that good programmers use when writing code.  Separation of concerns is a longstanding practice which we are applying to back-end architecture with many potential benefits.  I find it to be a logical and extremely effective approach and plan on incorporating these practices in my future work.</p>
